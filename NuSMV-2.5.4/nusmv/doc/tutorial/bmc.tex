In this section we give a short introduction to the use of Bounded Model
Checking (BMC) in \nusmv. For a more in-depth 
introduction to the theory underlying BMC please refer to \cite{BCCZ99}.
%
To perform SAT based bounded model checking \nusmv needs to be linked
to an external Sat Solver. If none is provided, all Bounded Model
Checking routines in \nusmv will not be available. Currently
\nusmv supports two SAT solvers: MiniSat and Zchaff.

% % % A simple model

Consider the following model, representing a simple, deterministic
counter modulo $8$ (we assume that the following specification is
contained in file \filename{bmc\_tutorial.smv}):
\begin{alltt}
MODULE main
VAR 
  y : 0..15;
ASSIGN 
  init(y) := 0;
TRANS
  case
     y = 7 :  next(y) = 0; 
     TRUE  :  next(y) = ((y + 1) mod 16);
  esac
\end{alltt}

This slightly artificial model has only the state variable \code{y}, ranging
from $0$ to $15$. The values of \code{y} are limited by the transition relation
to the [0, 7] interval. The counter starts from \code{0}, deterministically
increments by one the value of \code{y} at each transition up to $7$, and then
restarts from zero.

\section{Checking LTL Specifications}
\label{Checking LTL Specifications}
\index{Checking LTL Specifications (BMC)}
\index{Bounded Model Checking!Checking LTL Specifications}

We would like to check with BMC the LTL specification \code{G ( y=4 -> X y=6 )} 
expressing that ``each time the counter value is $4$, the next counter
value will be $6$''. This specification is obviously false, and our first
step is to use \nusmv BMC to demonstrate its falsity.
To this purpose, we add the following specification to file \filename{bmc\_tutorial.smv}:
\begin{alltt}
LTLSPEC G ( y=4 -> X y=6 )
\end{alltt}
and we instruct \nusmv to run in BMC by using command-line option \code{-bmc}:
\begin{alltt}
\shellprompt \shelltext{\nusmvtxt -bmc bmc\_tutorial.smv}
-- no counterexample found with bound 0 for specification 
   G(y = 4 -> X y = 6)
-- no counterexample found with bound 1 for ... 
-- no counterexample found with bound 2 for ...
-- no counterexample found with bound 3 for ...
-- no counterexample found with bound 4 for ...
-- specification  G (y = 4 ->  X y = 6)   is false
-- as demonstrated by the following execution sequence
Trace Description: BMC Counterexample
Trace Type: Counterexample
-> State: 1.1 <-
  y = 0
-> State: 1.2 <-
  y = 1
-> State: 1.3 <-
  y = 2
-> State: 1.4 <-
  y = 3
-> State: 1.5 <-
  y = 4
-> State: 1.6 <-
  y = 5
\shellprompt
\end{alltt}
%\noindent
\nusmv has found that the specification is false, and is showing us a
counterexample, i.e. a trace where the value of \code{y} becomes $4$ (at time
$4$) and at the next step is not $6$.
\begin{alltt}
 bound:   0    1    2    3    4    5
          o--->o--->o--->o--->o--->o
 state:  y=0  y=1  y=2  y=3  y=4  y=5 
\end{alltt}

The output produced by \nusmv shows that, before the counterexample
of length $5$ is found, \nusmv also tried to finds counterexamples of
lengths $0$ to $4$. However, there are no such
counterexamples. For instance, in the case of bound $4$, the traces of the
model have the following form:
\begin{alltt}
 bound:   0    1    2    3    4   
          o--->o--->o--->o--->o
 state:  y=0  y=1  y=2  y=3  y=4  
\end{alltt}
%\noindent
In this situation, \code{y} gets the value $4$, but it is impossible for
\nusmv to say anything about the following state.

\cindex{-bmc\_length}
In general, in BMC mode \nusmv tries to find a counterexample of
increasing length, and immediately stops when it succeeds, declaring
that the formula is false. The maximum number of iterations can be
controlled by using command-line option \code{-bmc\_length}.  The default
value is $10$. 
If the maximum number of iterations is reached and no counter-example is
found, then \nusmv exits, and the truth of the formula is not
decided. We remark that in this case we cannot conclude that the formula is true,
but only that any counter-example should be longer than the maximum length.
\begin{alltt}
\shellprompt \shelltext{\nusmvtxt -bmc -bmc\_length 4 bmc\_tutorial.smv}
-- no counterexample found with bound 0 for ...
-- no counterexample found with bound 1 for ...
-- no counterexample found with bound 2 for ...
-- no counterexample found with bound 3 for ...
-- no counterexample found with bound 4 for ...
\shellprompt 
\end{alltt}

Let us consider now another property, \code{!G F (y = 2)}, stating that
$y$ gets the value $2$ only a finite number of times. Again, this is a false
property due to the cyclic nature of the model. Let us modify the
specification of file \filename{bmc\_tutorial.smv} as follows:
\begin{alltt}
LTLSPEC !G F (y = 2)
\end{alltt}
%\noindent
and let us run \nusmv in BMC mode:
\begin{alltt}
\shellprompt \shelltext{\nusmvtxt -bmc bmc\_tutorial.smv}
-- no counterexample found with bound 0 for specification ! G  F y = 2
-- no counterexample found with bound 1 for ...
-- no counterexample found with bound 2 for ...
-- no counterexample found with bound 3 for ...
-- no counterexample found with bound 4 for ...
-- no counterexample found with bound 5 for ...
-- no counterexample found with bound 6 for ...
-- no counterexample found with bound 7 for ...
-- specification ! G  F y = 2   is false
-- as demonstrated by the following execution sequence
Trace Description: BMC Counterexample
Trace Type: Counterexample
-- Loop starts here
-> State: 1.1 <-
  y = 0
-> State: 1.2 <-
  y = 1
-> State: 1.3 <-
  y = 2
-> State: 1.4 <-
  y = 3
-> State: 1.5 <-
  y = 4
-> State: 1.6 <-
  y = 5
-> State: 1.7 <-
  y = 6
-> State: 1.8 <-
  y = 7
-> State: 1.9 <-
  y = 0
\shellprompt
\end{alltt}
In this example \nusmv has increased the problem bound until a
cyclic behavior of length 8 is found that contains a state where $y$ value
is $2$. Since the behavior is cyclic, state $1.3$ is entered infinitely
often and the property is false.
\begin{alltt}
                             =
         +---------------------------------------+
         |                                       |

\end{alltt}


\section{Finding Counterexamples}
\label{Finding Counterexamples}
\index{Finding Counterexamples (BMC)}
\index{Bounded Model Checking!Finding Counterexamples}
In general, BMC can find two kinds of counterexamples, depending on the
property being analyzed. For safety properties (e.g. like the first one
used in this tutorial), a counterexample is a finite sequence of
transitions through different states.  For liveness properties,
counterexamples are infinite but periodic sequences, and can be
represented in a bounded setting as a finite prefix followed by a loop,
i.e. a finite sequence of states ending with a loop back to some
previous state. So a counterexample which demonstrates the falsity of a
liveness property as ``\code{!~G F p}'' cannot be a finite sequence of
transitions. It must contain a loop which makes the infinite sequence of
transitions as well as we expected.
\begin{alltt}
                                   =
                        +---------------------+
                        |                     |
                        |                     |
                        |                     |
       o--->o-...->o--->o--->o-...->o--->o--->o--->o--->
time:  0    1      l-1  l    l+1    k-2  k-1  k    k+1   ...
\end{alltt}

Consider the above figure. It represents an examples of a generic
infinite counterexample, with its two parts: the prefix part (times from
$0$ to $l-1$), and the loop part (indefinitely from $l$ to $k-1$). Because the
loop always jumps to a previous time it is called \emph{loopback}. 
The loopback condition requires that state k is identical to state $l$. 
As a consequence, state $k+1$ is forced to be equal to
state $l+1$, state $k+2$ to be equal to state $l+2$, and so on.

\cindex{check\_ltlspec\_bmc\_onepb}
A fine-grained control of the length and of the loopback condition for
the counter-example can be specified by using command
\command{check\_ltlspec\_bmc\_onepb} in interactive mode. This command accepts options \commandopt{k}, that specifies the length of the
counter-example we are looking for, and \commandopt{l}, that defines the
loopback condition. Consider the following interactive session:
\begin{alltt}
\shellprompt \shelltext{\nusmvtxt -int bmc\_tutorial.smv}
\nusmvprompt \nusmvtext{go\_bmc}
\nusmvprompt \nusmvtext{check\_ltlspec\_bmc\_onepb -k 9 -l 0}
-- no counterexample found with bound 9 and loop at 0 for specification 
   ! G  F y = 2
\nusmvprompt \nusmvtext{check\_ltlspec\_bmc\_onepb -k 8 -l 1}
-- no counterexample found with bound 8 and loop at 1 for specification 
   ! G  F y = 2
\nusmvprompt \nusmvtext{check\_ltlspec\_bmc\_onepb -k 9 -l 1}
-- specification ! G  F y = 2   is false
-- as demonstrated by the following execution sequence
Trace Description: BMC Counterexample

-> State: 1.1 <-
  y = 0
-- Loop starts here

  y = 2

  y = 3

  y = 5

-> State: 1.9 <-
  y = 0
-> State: 1.10 <-
  y = 1
\nusmvprompt \nusmvtext{quit}
\shellprompt
\end{alltt}

\nusmv did not find a counterexample for cases ($k=9, l=0$) and
($k=8, l=1$). The following figures show that these case look for
counterexamples that do not match with the model of the counter, so it
is not possible for \nusmv to satisfy them.
\begin{alltt}
k = 9, l = 0:
                                =

         o--->o--->o--->o--->o--->o--->o--->o--->o--->o
bound:   0    1    2    3    4    5    6    7    8    9
y value: 0    1    2    3    4    5    6    7    0    1
          
\end{alltt}

\begin{alltt}
k = 8, l = 1:
                             =
              +----------------------------------+
              |                                  |
              |                                  |
              |                                  |
         o--->o--->o--->o--->o--->o--->o--->o--->o
bound:   0    1    2    3    4    5    6    7    8
y value: 0    1    2    3    4    5    6    7    0
\end{alltt}

Case ($k=9, l=1$), instead allows for a counter-example:
\begin{alltt}
k = 9, l = 1:
                                =
              +---------------------------------------+
              |                                       |
              |                                       |
              |                                       |
         o--->o--->o--->o--->o--->o--->o--->o--->o--->o
bound:   0    1    2    3    4    5    6    7    8    9
y value: 0    1    2    3    4    5    6    7    0    1
          
\end{alltt}
\index{Loopback Condition}
In \nusmv it is possible to specify the loopback condition in four
different ways:
\begin{itemize}
\item {\bf The loop as a precise time-point.}
Use a natural number as the argument of option \commandopt{l}.
\item {\bf The loop length.} 
Use a negative number as the argument of option \commandopt{l}.
The negative number is the
loop length, and you can also imagine it as a precise time-point loop
relative to the path bound.
\item {\bf No loopback.} 
Use symbol `X' as the argument of option \commandopt{l}. In this case
\nusmv will not find infinite counterexamples.
\item {\bf All possible loops.} 
Use symbol `*' as the argument of option \commandopt{l}. In this case
\nusmv will search counterexamples for paths with any possible
loopback structure. A counterexample with no loop will be also
searched. This is the default value for option \commandopt{l}.
\end{itemize}

In the following example we look for a counter-example of length $12$ with
a loop of length $8$:
\begin{alltt}
\shellprompt \shelltext{\nusmvtxt -int bmc\_tutorial.smv}
\nusmvprompt \nusmvtext{go\_bmc}
\nusmvprompt \nusmvtext{check\_ltlspec\_bmc\_onepb -k 12 -l -8}

\section{Checking Invariants}
\label{Checking Invariants}
\index{Checking Invariants (BMC)}
\index{Bounded Model Checking!Checking Invariants}

Ahead of version 2.2.2, \nusmv supported only the 2-step inductive
reasoning algorithm for invariant checking. As will become clear from
this tutorial, this algorithm is not complete, so in certain cases it
cannot be used to state whether an invariant specification is actually
true or false.

Since version 2.2.2, \nusmv supports total inductive reasoning,
which might be heavier than the 2-step approach but can
make invariant specifications provable even when the latter fails. 

Please refer to \cite{een04temporal} for a more in-depth explanation
of the theory underlying the algorithms for total temporal induction.


\subsection{2-Step Inductive Reasoning}
\index{Checking Invariants (BMC)!2-step Inductive Reasoning}
\index{Inductive Reasoning (2-Step)}

Bounded Model Checking in \nusmv can be used not only for checking LTL
specification, but also for checking invariants. An invariant is a
propositional property which must always hold.  BMC tries to prove the
truth of invariants via a process of inductive reasoning, by checking
if (i) the property holds in every initial state, and (ii) if it holds
in any state reachable from any state where it holds.

Let us modify file \filename{bmc\_tutorial.smv} by replacing the LTL specification
with the following invariant specification:
\begin{alltt}
INVARSPEC y in (0..12)
\end{alltt}
%\noindent 
and let us run \nusmv in BMC mode:
\begin{alltt}
\shellprompt \shelltext{\nusmvtxt -bmc bmc\_tutorial.smv}
-- cannot prove the invariant y in (0 .. 12) : the induction fails
-- as demonstrated by the following execution sequence
Trace Description: BMC Counterexample
Trace Type: Counterexample
-> State: 1.1 <-
  y = 12
-> State: 1.2 <-
  y = 13
\shellprompt
\end{alltt}

\nusmv reports that the given invariant cannot be proved, and it shows a
state satisfying ``\code{y} in ($0..12$)'' that has a successor state
not satisfying "\code{y} in ($0..12$)''. This two-steps sequence of
assignments shows why the induction fails. Note that \nusmv does not
state the given formula is really false, but only that it cannot be
proven to be true using the 2-step inductive reasoning described
previously.

If we try to prove the stronger invariant \code{y in (0..7)} we obtain:
\begin{alltt}
\shellprompt \shelltext{\nusmvtxt -bmc bmc\_tutorial.smv}
-- invariant y in (0 .. 7)   is true
\shellprompt
\end{alltt}
In this case \nusmv is able to prove that \code{y in (0..7)} is
true. 
As a consequence, also the weaker invariant \code{y in (0..12)} is true, even if
\nusmv is not able to prove it in BMC mode. 
On the other hand, the returned counter-example can be used
to \emph{strengthen} the invariant, until \nusmv is able to prove it.

\pagebreak[3]
Now we check the false invariant \code{y in (0..6)}:
\begin{alltt}
-- cannot prove the invariant y in (0 .. 6) : the induction fails
-- as demonstrated by the following execution sequence
Trace Description: BMC Counterexample
Trace Type: Counterexample
-> State: 1.1 <-
  y = 6
-> State: 1.2 <-
  y = 7
\nusmvprompt
\end{alltt}
As for property \code{y in (0..12)}, \nusmv returns a two steps
sequence showing that the induction fails. 
The difference is that, in the former case state 'y=12' is NOT reachable, while in the
latter case the state 'y=6' can be reached. 


\subsection{Complete Invariant Checking}
\index{Checking Invariants (BMC)!Complete Invariant Checking}

Since version 2.2.2, complete invariant checking can be obtained by
running the command \command{check\_invar\_bmc} in interactive mode, and
specifying the algorithm \code{``een-sorensson''} using the option
\commandopt{a}. If an incremental sat solver is available, the command \\
\command{check\_invar\_bmc\_inc} may also be used.

The classic 2-step algorithm was not able to prove directly the truth
of the invariant \\
\code{y in (0..12)}. This invariant can now be easily
checked by the complete invariant checking algorithm.

\begin{alltt}
\shellprompt \shelltext{\nusmvtxt -int bmc\_tutorial.smv}
\nusmvprompt \nusmvtext{go\_bmc}
\nusmvprompt \nusmvtext{check\_invar\_bmc -a een-sorensson -p "y in (0..12)"}
-- no proof or counterexample found with bound 0 ...
-- no proof or counterexample found with bound 1 ...
-- no proof or counterexample found with bound 2 ... 
-- no proof or counterexample found with bound 3 ...
-- no proof or counterexample found with bound 4 ... 
-- no proof or counterexample found with bound 5 ... 
-- invariant y in (0 .. 12)   is true
\nusmvprompt
\end{alltt}

As can be inferred from this example, \nusmv proved that the
invariant actually holds, requiring a length of 6 to prove it.

Complete invariant checking can also prove that an invariant does not
hold, and provide a convincing counter-example for it. For example
property \code{y in (0..6)} that the \code{``classic''} algorithm failed to check
is now proved to be false:

\begin{alltt}
\nusmvprompt \nusmvtext{check\_invar\_bmc -a een-sorensson -p "y in (0..6)"}
-- no proof or counterexample found with bound 0 ...
-- no proof or counterexample found with bound 1 ...
-- no proof or counterexample found with bound 2 ...
-- no proof or counterexample found with bound 3 ...
-- no proof or counterexample found with bound 4 ...
-- no proof or counterexample found with bound 5 ...
-- no proof or counterexample found with bound 6 ...
-- invariant y in (0 .. 6)   is false
-- as demonstrated by the following execution sequence
Trace Description: BMC Counterexample
Trace Type: Counterexample
-> State: 1.1 <-
  y = 0
-> State: 1.2 <-
  y = 1
-> State: 1.3 <-
  y = 2
-> State: 1.4 <-
  y = 3
-> State: 1.5 <-
  y = 4
-> State: 1.6 <-
  y = 5
-> State: 1.7 <-
  y = 6
-> State: 1.8 <-
  y = 7
\nusmvprompt
\end{alltt}

The provided counter-example shows that \code{y} actually can reach a
value out of the set \code{(0..6)}.
