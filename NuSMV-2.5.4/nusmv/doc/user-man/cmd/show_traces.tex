\begin{nusmvCommand} {show\_traces} {Shows the traces generated in a \nusmvhead session}

\cmdLine{show\_traces [-h] [-v] [-t] [-A] [-m | -o output-file] \linebreak {
  [-p plugin-no] [-a | trace\_number[.from\_state[:[to\_state]]]}}

\begin{cmdOpt}
\opt{-v} { Verbosely prints traces content (all state and frozen variables,
otherwise it prints out only those variables that have changed their
value from previous state). This option only applies when the Basic
Trace Explainer plugin is used to display the trace.}

\opt{-t}{ Prints only the total number of currently stored traces.}

\opt{-a}{ Prints all the currently stored traces.}

\opt{-m}{ Pipes the output through the program specified by the
\shellvar{PAGER} shell variable if defined, else through the \unix
command \shellcommand{more}.}

\opt{-o \parameter{\filename{output-file}}}{Writes the output generated by the command to
\filename{output-file}.}

\opt{-p \parameter{\natnum{plugin-no}}}{Uses the specified trace
  plugin to display the trace.}

\opt{\natnum{trace\_number}}{ The (ordinal) identifier number of the
  trace to be printed. Omitting the trace number causes the most
  recently generated trace to be printed.}

\opt{\natnum{from\_step}}{ The number of the first step of the trace
  to be printed. Negative numbers can be used to denote right-to-left
  indexes from the last step.}

\opt{\natnum{to\_step}}{ The number of the trace to be
  printed. Negative numbers can be used to denote right-to-left
  indexes from the last step. Omitting this parameter causes the
  entire suffix of the trace to be printed.}

\opt{-A}{Prints the trace(s) using a rewriting mapping for all
  symbols. The rewriting is the same used in
  \command{write\_flat\_model} with option \commandopt{A}.}
\end{cmdOpt}

Shows the traces currently stored in system memory, if any. By default
it shows the last generated trace, if any. Optional trace number can
be followed by two indexes (from\_state, to\_state), denoting a
trace ``slice''. Thus, it is possible to require printout only of an
arbitrary fragment of the trace (this can be helpful when inspecting
very big traces).

If the XML Format Output plugin is being used to save generated traces
to a file with the intent of reading them back in again at a later
date, then only one trace should be saved per file. This is because
the trace reader does not currently support multiple traces in one
file.
