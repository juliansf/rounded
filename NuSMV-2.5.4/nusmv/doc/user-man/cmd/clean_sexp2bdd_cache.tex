\begin{nusmvCommand} {clean\_sexp2bdd\_cache} 
{Cleans the cached results of evaluations of symbolic expressions
to ADD and BDD representations.}

\cmdLine{clean\_sexp2bdd\_cache [-h]}

During conversion of symbolic expressions to ADD and BDD
representations the results of evaluations are normally cached (see
additionally the environment variable
\envvar{enable\_sexp2bdd\_caching}). This allows to save time by avoid the
construction of BDD for the same symbolic expression several time.

In some situations it may be preferable to clean the cache and
free collected ADD and BDD. This operation can be done, for example,
to free some memory. Another possible reason is that dynamic
reordering may modify all existing BDDs, and cleaning the cache
thereby freeing the BDD may speed up the reordering.

This command is designed specifically to free the internal cache of
evaluated expressions and their ADDs and BDDs.
%
Note that only the cache of symbolic-expression-to-bdd evaluator is
freed.  BDDs of variables, constants and expressions collected in BDD
FSM or anywhere else are not freed.
