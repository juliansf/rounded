\begin{nusmvCommand} {encode\_variables} {Builds the BDD variables
    necessary to compile the model into a BDD.}

\cmdLine{encode\_variables [-h] [-i order-file]}

Generates the boolean BDD variables and the ADD needed to encode
propositionally the (symbolic) variables declared in the model. The
variables are created as default in the order in which they appear in
a depth first traversal of the hierarchy.\\The input order file can be
partial and can contain variables not declared in the model. Variables
not declared in the model are simply discarded. Variables declared in
the model which are not listed in the ordering input file will be
created and appended at the end of the given ordering list, according
to the default ordering.

\begin{cmdOpt}
\opt{-i \parameter{\filename{order-file}}}{Sets the environment variable
\envvar{input\_order\_file} to \filename{order-file}, and reads the
variable ordering to be used from file  \filename{order-file}. This can
be combined with the \command{write\_order} command. The variable
ordering is written to a file, which can be inspected and reordered by
the user, and then read back in.}
