%% BMC PICK STATE
\begin{nusmvCommand}{bmc\_pick\_state} {Picks a state from the set of initial states}

\cmdLine{bmc\_pick\_state [-h] [-v] [-c "constraint" | -s trace.state] [-r | -i [-a]]}

Chooses an element from the set of initial states, and makes it the
current state (replacing the old one). The chosen state is stored as
the Ô¨Årst state of a new trace ready to be lengthened by steps states
by the \command{bmc\_simulate} command or the \command{bmc\_inc\_simulate} command.


\begin{cmdOpt}
\opt{-v}{Verbosely prints the generated trace}
\opt{-c \parameter{\it{constraint}}}{Set a constraint to narrow initial states.}
\opt{-s \parameter{\it{state}}}{Picks state from trace.state label.}
\opt{-r}{Randomly picks a state from the set of initial states.}
\opt{-i}{Enters simulation's interactive mode.}
\opt{-a}{Displays all the state variables (changed and unchanged)
  in the interactive session}

%% BMC SIMULATE
\begin{nusmvCommand}{bmc\_simulate} {Generates a trace of the model from 0 (zero) to k}

\cmdLine{bmc\_simulate [-h] [-p | -v] [-r] [[-c "constraints"] | [-t
      "constraints"] ] [-k steps]}

\command{bmc\_simulate} does not require a specification to build the
problem, because only the model is used to build it.  The problem
length is represented by the \commandopt{k} command parameter, or by
its default value stored in the environment variable
\envvar{bmc\_length}.

\begin{cmdOpt}
\opt{-p}{Prints the generated trace (only changed variables).}
\opt{-v}{Prints the generated trace (all variables).}
\opt{-r}{Picks a state from a set of possible future states in a random way.}
\opt{-c \parameter{\it{constraint}}}{Performs a simulation in which
  computation is restricted to states satisfying those
  \code{constraints}. The desired sequence of states could not exist
  if such constraints were too strong or it may happen that at some
  point of the simulation a future state satisfying those constraints
  doesn't exist: in that case a trace with a number of states less
  than \code{steps} trace is obtained.  Note: \code{constraints} must
  be enclosed between double quotes \code{" "}.  The expression cannot
  contain \code{next} operators, and is automatically shifted by one
  state in order to constraint only the next steps}

  than \code{steps} trace is obtained.  Note: \code{constraints} must
  be enclosed between double quotes \code{" "}.  The expression can
  contain \code{next} operators, and is NOT automatically shifted by
  one state as done with option \code{-c}}

\opt{\natnum{-k steps}}{ Maximum length of the path according to the
  constraints.  The length of a trace could contain less than
  \code{steps} states: this is the case in which simulation stops in

  \varName{default\_simulation\_steps} environment variable}

%% BMC INC SIMULATE
\begin{nusmvCommand}{bmc\_inc\_simulate} {Generates a trace of the model from 0 (zero) to k}

\cmdLine{bmc\_inc\_simulate [-h] [-p | -v] [-r | -i [-a]] [[-c "constraints"] |
    [-t "constraints"] ] [-k steps]}

Performs incremental simulation of the model.
\command{bmc\_inc\_simulate} does not require a specification to build the
problem, because only the model is used to build it.  The problem
length is represented by the \commandopt{k} command parameter, or by
its default value stored in the environment variable
\envvar{bmc\_length}.

\cmdLine{bmc\_simulate\_check\_feasible\_constraints [-h] [-q] [-c "constr"]}

Checks if the given constraints are feasible for BMC simulation.

\begin{cmdOpt}
\opt{-q}{Prints the output in compact form.}
\opt{-c \parameter{\it{constr}}}{Specify one constraint whose
  feasability has to be checked (can be used multiple times, order is
