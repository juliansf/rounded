\begin{nusmvCommand} {goto\_state} {Goes to a given state of a trace}

\cmdLine{goto\_state [-h] state\_label}

Makes \code{state\_label} the \emph{current state}. This command is used to
navigate along traces produced by \nusmv. During the navigation, there
is a \emph{current state}, and the \emph{current trace} is the trace
the \emph{current state} belongs to.

\code{state\_label} is in the form \emph{trace.state} where 
\begin{description}
  \item [trace] is the index of the trace which the state has to be taken from.

  \item [state] is the index of the state within the given
    trace. If \code{state} is a negative number, then the state
    index is intended to be relative to the length of the given
    trace. For example \code{2.-1} means the last state of the
    trace \code{2}. 2.-2 is the state before the last state, etc.
\end{description}
