\begin{nusmvCommand}{process\_model} {Performs the batch steps and then returns control to the interactive shell.}

\cmdLine{process\_model [-h] [-f] [-r] [-i model-file] [-m Method]}

Reads the model, compiles it into BDD and performs the model checking
of all the specification contained in it. If the environment variable
\envvar{forward\_search} has been set before, then the set of
reachable states is computed. If the option \code{-r} is specified,
the reordering of variables is performed and a dump of the variable
ordering is performed accordingly. This command simulates the batch
behavior of \nusmv and then returns the control to the interactive
shell.

\begin{cmdOpt}
\opt{-f}{Forces the model construction even when Cone Of Influence is
enabled.}
\opt{-r}{Forces a variable reordering at the end of the computation, 
 and dumps the new variables ordering to the default ordering file. 
 This options acts like the command line option \code{-reorder}.}
 
\opt{-i \parameter{\filename{model-file}}}{Sets the environment variable
\envvar{input\_file} to file \filename{model-file}, and reads the
model from file \filename{model-file}.}
 
\opt{-m \parameter{\set{Method}{Monolithic, Threshold, Iwls95CP}}}{Sets the environment variable
\envvar{partition\_method} to \code{Method} and uses it as
partitioning method.}
