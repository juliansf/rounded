\begin{nusmvCommand}{show\_dependencies} {Shows the dependencies for the given expression}

\cmdLine{show\_dependencies [-h] [-k bound] -e expression}

Prints the set of variables that are in the dependency set of the given expression.
If the bound is specified using the -k argument, then the computation of the dependencies is 
done until the bound has been reached.
If not specified, the computation is performed until no new dependencies are found.

\begin{cmdOpt}

\opt{-h}{Shows the command usage}

\opt{-k bound}{Sets the bound limit for the dependencies computation}

\opt{-e expr}{The expression on which the dependencies are computed}

\end{cmdOpt}
