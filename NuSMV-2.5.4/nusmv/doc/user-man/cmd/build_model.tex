\begin{nusmvCommand} {build\_model} {Compiles the flattened hierarchy
    into a BDD}

\cmdLine{build\_model [-h] [-f] [-m Method]}

Compiles the flattened hierarchy into a BDD (initial states, invariants,
  and transition relation) using the method specified in the
  environment variable \envvar{partition\_method} for building the
  transition relation.\\

\begin{cmdOpt}

\opt{-m \parameter{\set{Method}{Monolithic, Threshold, Iwls95CP}}}{ Sets the environment variable
           \envvar{partition\_method} to the value \code{Method}, and
           then builds the transition relation. Available methods are
           \varvalue{Monolithic}, \varvalue{Threshold} and
           \varvalue{Iwls95CP}.}
 
\opt{-f}{ Forces model construction. By default, only one partition
            method is allowed. This option allows to overcome this
            default, and to build the transition relation with
            different partitioning methods.}
