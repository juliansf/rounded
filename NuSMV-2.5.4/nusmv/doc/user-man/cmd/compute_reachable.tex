\begin{nusmvCommand}{compute\_reachable} {Computes the set of reachable states}

\cmdLine{compute\_reachable [-h] [-k number] [-t seconds]}

Computes the set of reachable states. The result is then used to
simplify image and preimage computations. This can result in improved
performances for models with sparse state spaces. Sometimes the
execution of this command can take much time because the computation
of reachable states may be very expensive. Use the \commandopt{k} option
to limit the number of forward step to perform.  If the reachable
states has been already computed the command returns immediately since
there is nothing more to compute.

\begin{cmdOpt}
\opt{-k \parameter{number}}{ If specified, limits the computation of
  reachable states to perform number steps forward starting from the
  last computed frontier. This means that you can expand the computed
  reachable states incrementally using this option.}
  
\opt{-t \parameter{seconds}}{ If specified, forces the computation
  of reachable states to end after ``seconds'' seconds. This limit
  could not be precise since the if the computation of a step is
  running when the limit occurs, the computation is not interrupted
  until the end of the step}
\end{cmdOpt}
