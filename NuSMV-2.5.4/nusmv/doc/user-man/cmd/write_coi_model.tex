\begin{nusmvCommand} {write\_coi\_model} {Writes a restricted flat model to a file}

\cmdLine{write\_coi\_model [-h] [-n idx | -p "expr" | -P "name"] [-c | -l | -i | -s | -q] [-C] [-g] }

Writes the currently loaded SMV model in the specified file, after
having flattened it. If a property is specified, the dumped model is
the result of applying the Cone Of Influence over that
property. otherwise, a restricted SMV model is dumped for each
property in the property database.

Processes are eliminated and a corresponding equivalent model is
printed out.

If no file is specified, stderr is used for output
