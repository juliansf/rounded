\begin{nusmvCommand} {source} {Executes a sequence of commands from a file}

\cmdLine{source [-h] [-p] [-s] [-x] <file> [<args>]}

Reads and executes commands from a file.

\begin{cmdOpt}
\opt{-p}{Prints a prompt before reading each command.}

\opt{-s}{Silently ignores an attempt to execute commands from a
nonexistent file.}

\opt{-x}{Echoes each command before it is executed.}

\opt{<file>}{ File name.}
\end{cmdOpt}

Arguments on the command line after the filename are remembered but
not evaluated.  Commands in the script file can then refer to these
arguments using the history substitution mechanism.  EXAMPLE: \\
Contents of \filename{test.scr}:\\
  
\code{read\_model -i \%:2\\
  flatten\_hierarchy\\
  build\_variables\\
  build\_model\\
  compute\_fairness\\
  }\\
Typing \command{source test.scr short.smv} on the command line will execute the
  sequence\\
 
\code{read\_model -i short.smv\\
  flatten\_hierarchy\\
  build\_variables\\
  build\_model\\
  compute\_fairness\\
  }\\
(In this case  \code{\%:0} gets \command{source}, \code{\%:1} gets
  \filename{test.scr}, and  \code{\%:2} gets \filename{short.smv}.)
  If you type \command{alias st source test.scr} and then type \texttt{st short.smv bozo},
  you will execute\\
 
 \code{read\_model -i bozo\\
  flatten\_hierarchy\\
  build\_variables\\
  build\_model\\
  compute\_fairness\\
  }\\
  because \texttt{bozo} was the second argument on the last command line typed.  In
  other words, command substitution in a script file depends on how the script
  file was invoked. Switches passed to a command are also counted as
  positional parameters. Therefore, if you type \texttt{st -x short.smv bozo},
  you will execute\\
 
 \code{read\_model -i short.smv\\
  flatten\_hierarchy\\
  build\_variables\\
  build\_model\\
  compute\_fairness\\
  }\\
  To pass the \texttt{-x} switch (or any other switch) to \command{source} when the
  script uses positional parameters, you may define an alias. For
  instance, \command{alias srcx source -x}.

  See the variable \envvar{on\_failure\_script\_quits} for further information.
