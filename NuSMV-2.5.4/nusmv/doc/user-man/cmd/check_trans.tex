\begin{nusmvCommand}{check\_trans} {Checks the transition relation for totality.}

\cmdLine{check\_trans [-h] [-m | -o output-file]}\\

Checks if the transition relation is total. If the transition relation
is not total then a potential deadlock state is shown out.

\begin{cmdOpt}

\opt{-m}{Pipes the output generated by the command to the program
specified by the  \shellvar{PAGER} shell variable if defined, else
through the \unix command \shellcommand{more}.}
            
\opt{-o \parameter{\filename{output-file}}}{Writes the output generated by the command to
the file \filename{output-file}.}

\end{cmdOpt}
At the beginning reachable states are computed in order to guarantee
that deadlock states are actually reachable.
