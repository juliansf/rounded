  write_coi_model - Writes a flat model of SMV file, restricted to the COI of
  the model properties

   write_coi_model [-h] [-o filename] [-n | -p | -P ] | [-c] | [-l] | [-i]
   | [-s] | [-q] | [-p expr] | [-C] | [-g]

   Writes the currently loaded SMV model in the specified file, after
   having flattened it. If a property is specified, the dumped model is
   the result of applying the COI over that property. otherwise, a
   restricted SMV model is dumped for each property in the property
   database. Processes are eliminated and a corresponding equivalent model
   is printed out. If no file is specified, stderr is used for output

   Command options:

   -o filename
          Attempts to write the flat and boolean SMV model in filename.

   -c
          Dumps COI model for all CTL properties

   -l
          Dumps COI model for all LTL properties

   -i
          Dumps COI model for all INVAR properties

   -s
          Dumps COI model for all PSL properties

   -q
          Dumps COI model for all COMPUTE properties

   -p expr
          Applies COI for the given expression "expr"

   -n idx
          Applies COI for property stored at index "idx"

   -P name
          Applies COI for property named "name" idx

   -C
          Only prints the list of variables that are in the COI of
          properties

   -g
          Dumps the COI model that represents the union of all COI
          properties
