  check_ltlspec - Performs LTL model checking
     __________________________________________________________________

   check_ltlspec [-h] [-m | -o output-file] [-n number | -p "ltl-expr [IN
   context]" | -P "name"]

   Performs model checking of LTL formulas. LTL model checking is reduced
   to CTL model checking as described in the paper by [CGH97].

   A ltl-expr to be checked can be specified at command line using option
   -p. Alternatively, option -n can be used for checking a particular
   formula in the property database. If neither -n nor -p are used, all
   the LTLSPEC formulas in the database are checked.

   Command options:

   -m
          Pipes the output generated by the command in processing LTLSPECs
          to the program specified by the PAGER shell variable if defined,
          else through the Unix command "more".

   -o output-file
          Writes the output generated by the command in processing
          LTLSPECs to the file output-file.

   -p "ltl-expr [IN context]"
          An LTL formula to be checked. context is the module instance
          name which the variables in ltl_expr must be evaluated in.

   -n number
          Checks the LTL property with index number in the property
          database.

   -P name
          Checks the LTL property named name in the property database.
