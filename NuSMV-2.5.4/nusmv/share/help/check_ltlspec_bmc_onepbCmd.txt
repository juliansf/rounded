  check_ltlspec_bmc_onepb - Checks the given LTL specification, or all LTL
  specifications if no formula is given. Checking parameters are the single
  problem bound and the loopback values
     __________________________________________________________________

   check_ltlspec_bmc_onepb [-h | -n idx | -p "formula" [IN context] | -P
   "name"] [-k length] [-l loopback] [-o filename]

   As command check_ltlspec_bmc but it produces only one single problem
   with fixed bound and loopback values, with no iteration of the problem
   bound from zero to max_length.

   Command options:

   -n index
          index is the numeric index of a valid LTL specification formula
          actually located in the properties database.
          The validity of index value is checked out by the system.

   -p "formula [IN context]"
          Checks the formula specified on the command-line.
          context is the module instance name which the variables in
          formula must be evaluated in.

   -P name
          Checks the LTLSPEC property with name name in the property
          database.

   -k length
          length is the problem bound used when generating the single
          problem. Only natural number are valid values for this option.
          If no value is given the environment variable bmc_length is
          considered instead.

   -l loopback
          loopback value may be:
          - a natural number in (0, max_length-1). Positive sign ('+') can
          be also used as prefix of the number. Any invalid combination of
          length and loopback will be skipped during the
          generation/solving process.
          - a negative number in (-1, -bmc_length). In this case loopback
          is considered a value relative to length. Any invalid
          combination of length and loopback will be skipped during the
          generation/solving process.
          - the symbol 'X', which means "no loopback"
          - the symbol '*', which means "all possible loopback from zero
          to length-1"

   -o filename
          filename is the name of the dumped dimacs file, without
          extension.
          It may contain special symbols which will be macro-expanded to
          form the real file name. Possible symbols are:
          - @F: model name with path part
          - @f: model name without path part
          - @k: current problem bound
          - @l: current loopback value
          - @n: index of the currently processed formula in the properties
          database
          - @@: the '@' character
