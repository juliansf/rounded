  check_ltlspec_bmc_inc - Checks the given LTL specification, or all LTL
  specifications if no formula is given, using incremental algorithms. Checking
  parameters are the maximum length and the loopback values
     __________________________________________________________________

   check_ltlspec_bmc_inc [-h | -n idx | -p "formula" [IN context] | -P
   "name"] [-k max_length] [-l loopback]

   This command generates one or more problems, and calls (incremental)
   SAT solver for each one. Each problem is related to a specific problem
   bound, which increases from zero (0) to the given maximum problem
   length. Here "length" is the bound of the problem that system is going
   to generate and/or solve.
   In this context the maximum problem bound is represented by the -k
   command parameter, or by its default value stored in the environment
   variable bmc_length.
   The single generated problem also depends on the "loopback" parameter
   you can explicitly specify by the -l option, or by its default value
   stored in the environment variable bmc_loopback.
   The property to be checked may be specified using the -n idx, the -p
   "formula" or the -P "name" options.

   Command options:

   -n index
          index is the numeric index of a valid LTL specification formula
          actually located in the properties database.

   -p "formula" [IN context]
          Checks the formula specified on the command-line.
          context is the module instance name which the variables in
          formula must be evaluated in.

   -P name
          Checks the LTLSPEC property with name name in the property
          database.

   -k max_length
          max_length is the maximum problem bound must be reached. Only
          natural number are valid values for this option. If no value is
          given the environment variable bmc_length is considered instead.

   -l loopback
          loopback value may be:
          - a natural number in (0, max_length-1). Positive sign ('+') can
          be also used as prefix of the number. Any invalid combination of
          length and loopback will be skipped during the
          generation/solving process.
          - a negative number in (-1, -bmc_length). In this case loopback
          is considered a value relative to max_length. Any invalid
          combination of length and loopback will be skipped during the
          generation/solving process.
          - the symbol 'X', which means "no loopback"
          - the symbol '*', which means "all possible loopback from zero
          to length-1"
