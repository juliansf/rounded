  is *deprecated* in 2.4
     __________________________________________________________________

   print_clusterinfo [-h] | [-m] | [-o output-file]

   Deprecated in 2.4: use print_fsm_stats instead. This command prints out
   information regarding each cluster. In particular for each cluster it
   prints out the cluster number, the size of the cluster (in BDD nodes),
   the variables occurring in it, the size of the cube that has to be
   quantified out relative to the cluster and the variables to be
   quantified out.

   Command options:

   -m
          Pipes the output generated by the command through the program
          specified by the PAGER shell variable if defined, or through the
          UNIX utility "more".

   -o output-file
          Redirects the generated output to the file output-file.
