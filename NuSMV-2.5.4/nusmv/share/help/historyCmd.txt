  history - list previous commands and their event numbers
     __________________________________________________________________

   history [-h] [<num>]

   Lists previous commands and their event numbers. This is a UNIX-like
   history mechanism inside the NuSMV shell.

   Command options:

   <num>
          Lists the last <num> events. Lists the last 30 events if <num>
          is not specified.

   History Substitution:

   The history substitution mechanism is a simpler version of the csh
   history substitution mechanism. It enables you to reuse words from
   previously typed commands.

   The default history substitution character is the `%' (`!' is default
   for shell escapes, and `#' marks the beginning of a comment). This can
   be changed using the "set" command. In this description '%' is used as
   the history_char. The `%' can appear anywhere in a line. A line
   containing a history substitution is echoed to the screen after the
   substitution takes place. `%' can be preceded by a `\' in order to
   escape the substitution, for example, to enter a `%' into an alias or
   to set the prompt.

   Each valid line typed at the prompt is saved. If the "history" variable
   is set (see help page for "set"), each line is also echoed to the
   history file. You can use the "history" command to list the previously
   typed commands.

   Substitutions:

   At any point in a line these history substitutions are available.

   %:0
          Initial word of last command.

   %:n
          n-th argument of last command.

   %$
          Last argument of last command.

   %*
          All but initial word of last command.

   %%
          Last command.

   %stuf
          Last command beginning with "stuf".

   %n
          Repeat the n-th command.

   %-n
          Repeat the n-th previous command.

   ^old^new
          Replace "old" with "new" in previous command. Trailing spaces
          are significant during substitution. Initial spaces are not
          significant.
