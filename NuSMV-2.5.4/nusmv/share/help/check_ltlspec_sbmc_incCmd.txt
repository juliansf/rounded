  check_ltlspec_sbmc_inc - Incremental SBMC LTL model checking
     __________________________________________________________________

   check_ltlspec_sbmc_inc [-h | -n idx | -p "formula" [IN context] | -P
   "name"] [-k max_length] [-c] [-N]

   This command generates one or more problems, and calls SAT solver for
   each one. Each problem is related to a specific problem bound, which
   increases from zero (0) to the given maximum problem length. Here
   "length" is the bound of the problem that system is going to generate
   and/or solve.
   In this context the maximum problem bound is represented by the -k
   command parameter, or by its default value stored in the environment
   variable bmc_length.
   The property to be checked may be specified using the -n idx, -p
   "formula", or -P "property_name" options.
   Completeness check, although slower, can be used to determine whether
   the property holds.

   Command options:

   -n index
          index is the numeric index of a valid LTL specification formula
          actually located in the properties database.

   -p "formula" [IN context]
          Checks the formula specified on the command-line.
          context is the module instance name which the variables in
          formula must be evaluated in.

   -P name
          Checks the LTLSPEC property with name name in the property
          database.

   -k max_length
          max_length is the maximum problem bound must be reached. Only
          natural number are valid values for this option. If no value is
          given the environment variable bmc_length is considered instead.

   -c
          Performs completeness check at every step. This can be
          effectively used to determine whether a property holds.

   -N
          Does not perform virtual unrolling.
