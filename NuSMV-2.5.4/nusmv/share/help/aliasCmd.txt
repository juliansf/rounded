  alias - Provides an alias for a command
     __________________________________________________________________

   alias [-h] [<name> [<string>]]

   The "alias" command, if given no arguments, will print the definition
   of all current aliases.

   Given a single argument, it will print the definition of that alias (if
   any). Given two arguments, the keyword <name> becomes an alias for the
   command string <string>, replacing any other alias with the same name.

   Command options:

   <name>
          Alias

   <string>
          Command string

   It is possible to create aliases that take arguments by using the
   history substitution mechanism. To protect the history substitution
   character `%' from immediate expansion, it must be preceded by a `\'
   when entering the alias.

   For example:

   NuSMV> alias read "read_model -i \%:1.smv ; set input_order_file
   \%:1.ord" NuSMV> read short

   will create an alias `read', execute "read_model -i short.smv; set
   input_order_file short.ord".

   And again:

   NuSMV> alias echo2 "echo Hi ; echo \%* !"
   NuSMV> echo2 happy birthday

   will print:

   Hi
   happy birthday !
   CAVEAT: Currently there is no check to see if there is a circular
   dependency in the alias definition. e.g.

   NuSMV> alias foo "echo print_bdd_stats; foo"
   creates an alias which refers to itself. Executing the command foo will
   result an infinite loop during which the command print_bdd_stats will
   be executed.
