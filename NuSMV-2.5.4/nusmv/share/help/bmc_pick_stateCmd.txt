  bmc_pick_state - Picks a state from the set of initial states
     __________________________________________________________________

   bmc_pick_state [-h] [-v] ] [-c "constraint" | -s trace.state] [-r] [-a
   [-i]]

   Chooses an element from the set of initial states, and makes it the
   current state (replacing the old one). The chosen state is stored as
   the first state of a new trace ready to be lengthened by steps states
   by the bmc_simulate or bmc_inc_simulate commands. A constraint can be
   provided to restrict the set of candidate states.

   Command Options:

   -v
          Verbosely prints out chosen state (all state variables,
          otherwise it prints out only the label t.1 of the state chosen,
          where t is the number of the new trace, that is the number of
          traces so far generated plus one).

   -r
          Randomly picks a state from the set of initial states.

   -i
          Enters simulation's interactive mode.

   -a
          Displays all the state variables (changed and unchanged) in the
          interactive session

   -c "constraint"
          Uses constraint to restrict the set of initial states in which
          the state has to be picked.

   -s trace.state
          Picks state from trace.state label. A new simulation trace will
          be created by copying prefix of the source trace up to specified
          state.
