  gen_ltlspec_bmc_onepb - Dumps into one dimacs file the problem generated for
  the given LTL specification, or for all LTL specifications if no formula is
  explicitly given. Generation and dumping parameters are the problem bound and
  the loopback values
     __________________________________________________________________

   gen_ltlspec_bmc_onepb [-h | -n idx | -p "formula" [IN context] | -P
   "name"] [-k length] [-l loopback] [-o filename]

   As the gen_ltlspec_bmc command, but it generates and dumps only one
   problem given its bound and loopback.

   Command options:

   -n index
          index is the numeric index of a valid LTL specification formula
          actually located in the properties database.
          The validity of index value is checked out by the system.

   -p "formula [IN context]"
          Checks the formula specified on the command-line.
          context is the module instance name which the variables in
          formula must be evaluated in.

   -P name
          Checks the LTLSPEC property with name name in the property
          database.

   -k length
          length is the single problem bound used to generate and dump it.
          Only natural number are valid values for this option. If no
          value is given the environment variable bmc_length is considered
          instead.

   -l loopback
          loopback value may be:
          - a natural number in (0, length-1). Positive sign ('+') can be
          also used as prefix of the number. Any invalid combination of
          length and loopback will be skipped during the generation and
          dumping process.
          - a negative number in (-1, -length). Any invalid combination of
          length and loopback will be skipped during the generation
          process.
          - the symbol 'X', which means "no loopback"
          - the symbol '*', which means "all possible loopback from zero
          to length-1"

   -o filename
          filename is the name of the dumped dimacs file, without
          extension.
          If this options is not specified, variable bmc_dimacs_filename
          will be considered. The file name string may contain special
          symbols which will be macro-expanded to form the real file name.
          Possible symbols are:
          - @F: model name with path part
          - @f: model name without path part
          - @k: current problem bound
          - @l: current loopback value
          - @n: index of the currently processed formula in the properties
          database
          - @@: the '@' character
