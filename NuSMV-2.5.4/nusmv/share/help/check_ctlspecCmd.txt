  check_ctlspec - Performs fair CTL model checking.
     __________________________________________________________________

   check_ctlspec [-h] [-m | -o output-file] [-n number | -p "ctl-expr [IN
   context]" | -P "name"]

   Performs fair CTL model checking.

   A ctl-expr to be checked can be specified at command line using option
   -p. Alternatively, option -n or -P can be used for checking a
   particular formula in the property database. If neither -n nor -p are
   used, all the SPEC formulas in the database are checked.

   Command options:

   -m
          Pipes the output generated by the command in processing SPECs to
          the program specified by the PAGER shell variable if defined,
          else through the UNIX command "more".

   -o output-file
          Writes the output generated by the command in processing SPECs
          to the file output-file.

   -p "ctl-expr [IN context]"
          A CTL formula to be checked. context is the module instance name
          which the variables in ctl-expr must be evaluated in.

   -n number
          Checks the CTL property with index number in the property
          database.

   -P name
          Checks the CTL property with name name in the property database.

   If the ag_only_search environment variable has been set, and the set of
   reachable states has already been computed, then a specialized
   algorithm to check AG formulas is used instead of the standard model
   checking algorithms.
