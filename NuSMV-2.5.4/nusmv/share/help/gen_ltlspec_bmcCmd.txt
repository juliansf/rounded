  gen_ltlspec_bmc - Dumps into one or more dimacs files the given LTL
  specification, or all LTL specifications if no formula is given. Generation
  and dumping parameters are the maximum bound and the loopback values
     __________________________________________________________________

   gen_ltlspec_bmc [-h | -n idx | -p "formula" [IN context] | -P "name"]
   [-k max_length] [-l loopback] [-o filename]

   This command generates one or more problems, and dumps each problem
   into a dimacs file. Each problem is related to a specific problem
   bound, which increases from zero (0) to the given maximum problem
   bound. In this short description "length" is the bound of the problem
   that system is going to dump out.
   In this context the maximum problem bound is represented by the
   max_length parameter, or by its default value stored in the environment
   variable bmc_length.
   Each dumped problem also depends on the loopback you can explicitly
   specify by the -l option, or by its default value stored in the
   environment variable bmc_loopback.
   The property to be checked may be specified using the -n idx, the -p
   "formula" or the -P "name" options.
   You may specify dimacs file name by using the option -o "filename",
   otherwise the default value stored in the environment variable
   bmc_dimacs_filename will be considered.

   Command options:

   -n index
          index is the numeric index of a valid LTL specification formula
          actually located in the properties database.
          The validity of index value is checked out by the system.

   -p "formula [IN context]"
          Checks the formula specified on the command-line.
          context is the module instance name which the variables in
          formula must be evaluated in.

   -P name
          Checks the LTLSPEC property with name name in the property
          database.

   -k max_length
          max_length is the maximum problem bound used when increasing
          problem bound starting from zero. Only natural number are valid
          values for this option. If no value is given the environment
          variable bmc_length value is considered instead.

   -l loopback
          loopback value may be:
          - a natural number in (0, max_length-1). Positive sign ('+') can
          be also used as prefix of the number. Any invalid combination of
          bound and loopback will be skipped during the generation and
          dumping process.
          - a negative number in (-1, -bmc_length). In this case loopback
          is considered a value relative to max_length. Any invalid
          combination of bound and loopback will be skipped during the
          generation process.
          - the symbol 'X', which means "no loopback"
          - the symbol '*', which means "all possible loopback from zero
          to length-1"

   -o filename
          filename is the name of dumped dimacs files, without extension.
          If this options is not specified, variable bmc_dimacs_filename
          will be considered. The file name string may contain special
          symbols which will be macro-expanded to form the real file name.
          Possible symbols are:
          - @F: model name with path part
          - @f: model name without path part
          - @k: current problem bound
          - @l: current loopback value
          - @n: index of the currently processed formula in the properties
          database
          - @@: the '@' character
