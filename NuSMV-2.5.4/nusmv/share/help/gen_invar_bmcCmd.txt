  gen_invar_bmc - Generates the given invariant, or all invariants if no
  formula is given
     __________________________________________________________________

   gen_invar_bmc [-h | -n idx | -p "formula" [IN context] | -P "name"] [-o
   filename]

   Command options:

   -n index
          index is the numeric index of a valid INVAR specification
          formula actually located in the properties database.
          The validity of index value is checked out by the system.

   -p "formula" [IN context]
          Checks the formula specified on the command-line.
          context is the module instance name which the variables in
          formula must be evaluated in.

   -P "name"
          Checks the invariant property stored in the properties database
          with name "name"

   -o filename
          filename is the name of the dumped dimacs file, without
          extension.
          If you do not use this option the dimacs file name is taken from
          the environment variable bmc_invar_dimacs_filename.
          File name may contain special symbols which will be
          macro-expanded to form the real dimacs file name. Possible
          symbols are:
          - @F: model name with path part
          - @f: model name without path part
          - @n: index of the currently processed formula in the properties
          database
          - @@: the '@' character
