  bmc_inc_simulate - Incrementally generates a trace of the model performing a
  given number of steps.

   bmc_inc_simulate [-h] [-p | -v] [-r] [[-c "constraints"] | [-t
   "constraints"]

   bmc_inc_simulate performs incremental simulation of the model. If no
   length is specified with -k command parameter, then the number of steps
   of simulation to perform is taken from the value stored in the
   environment variable bmc_length.
   Command Options:

   -p
          Prints current generated trace (only those variables whose value
          changed from the previous state).

   -v
          Verbosely prints current generated trace (changed and unchanged
          state variables).

   -r
          Picks a state from a set of possible future states in a random
          way.

   -i
          Enters simulation's interactive mode.

   -a
          Displays all the state variables (changed and unchanged) in the
          interactive session

   -c "constraints"
          Performs a simulation in which computation is restricted to
          states satisfying those constraints. The desired sequence of
          states could not exist if such constraints were too strong or it
          may happen that at some point of the simulation a future state
          satisfying those constraints doesn't exist: in that case a trace
          with a number of states less than steps trace is obtained. The
          expression cannot contain next operators, and is automatically
          shifted by one state in order to constraint only the next steps

   -t "constraints"
          Performs a simulation in which computation is restricted to
          states satisfying those constraints. The desired sequence of
          states could not exist if such constraints were too strong or it
          may happen that at some point of the simulation a future state
          satisfying those constraints doesn't exist: in that case a trace
          with a number of states less than steps trace is obtained. The
          expression can contain next operators, and is NOT automatically
          shifted by one state as done with option -c

   -k steps
          Maximum length of the path according to the constraints. The
          length of a trace could contain less than steps states: this is
          the case in which simulation stops in an intermediate step
          because it may not exist any future state satisfying those
          constraints.
