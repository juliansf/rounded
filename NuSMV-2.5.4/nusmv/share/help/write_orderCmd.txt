  write_order - Writes variable order to file.
     __________________________________________________________________

   write_order [-h] [-b] [(-o | -f) order-file]

   Writes the current order of BDD variables in the file specified via the
   -o option. If no option is specified the environment variable
   output_order_file will be considered. If the variable output_order_file
   is unset (or set to an empty value) then standard output will be used.
   The option -b forces the dumped variable ordering to contain only
   boolean variables. All the scalar variables will be substituted by
   those variables bits that encode them. The variables bits will occur
   within the dumped variable ordering depending on the position they have
   within the system when the command is executed.

   Command options:

   -b
          Dumps bits of scalar variables instead of the single scalar
          variables. When specified, this option temporary overloads the
          current value of the system variable write_order_dumps_bits.

   -o order-file
          Sets the environment variable output_order_file to order-file
          and then dumps the ordering list into that file.

   -f order-file
          Alias for -o option. Supplied for backward compatibility.
