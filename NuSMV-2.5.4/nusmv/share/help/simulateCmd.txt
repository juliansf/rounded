  simulate - Performs a simulation from the current selected state
     __________________________________________________________________

   simulate [-h] [-p | -v] [-r | -i [-a]] [[-c "constraints"] | [-t
   "constraints"]

   Generates a sequence of at most steps states (representing a possible
   execution of the model), starting from the current state. The current
   state must be set via the pick_state or goto_state commands.

   It is possible to run the simulation in three ways (according to
   different command line policies): deterministic (the default mode),
   random and interactive.

   The resulting sequence is stored in a trace indexed with an integer
   number taking into account the total number of traces stored in the
   system. There is a different behavior in the way traces are built,
   according to how current state is set: current state is always put at
   the beginning of a new trace (so it will contain at most steps + 1
   states) except when it is the last state of an existent old trace. In
   this case the old trace is lengthened by at most steps states.

   Command Options:

   -p
          Prints current generated trace (only those variables whose value
          changed from the previous state).

   -v
          Verbosely prints current generated trace (changed and unchanged
          state variables).

   -r
          Picks a state from a set of possible future states in a random
          way.

   -i
          Enables the user to interactively choose every state of the
          trace, step by step. If the number of possible states is too
          high, then the user has to specify some constraints as simple
          expression. These constraints are used only for a single
          simulation step and are forgotten in the following ones. They
          are to be intended in an opposite way with respect to those
          constraints eventually entered with the pick_state command, or
          during an interactive simulation session (when the number of
          future states to be displayed is too high), that are local only
          to a single step of the simulation and are forgotten in the next
          one.

   -a
          Displays all the state variables (changed and unchanged) during
          every step of an interactive session. This option works only if
          the -i option has been specified.

   -c "constraints"
          Performs a simulation in which computation is restricted to
          states satisfying those constraints. The desired sequence of
          states could not exist if such constraints were too strong or it
          may happen that at some point of the simulation a future state
          satisfying those constraints doesn't exist: in that case a trace
          with a number of states less than steps trace is obtained. The
          expression cannot contain next operators, and is automatically
          shifted by one state in order to constraint only the next steps

   -t "constraints"
          Performs a simulation in which computation is restricted to
          states satisfying those constraints. The desired sequence of
          states could not exist if such constraints were too strong or it
          may happen that at some point of the simulation a future state
          satisfying those constraints doesn't exist: in that case a trace
          with a number of states less than steps trace is obtained. The
          expression can contain next operators, and is NOT automatically
          shifted by one state as done with option -c

   -k steps
          Maximum length of the path according to the constraints. The
          length of a trace could contain less than steps states: this is
          the case in which simulation stops in an intermediate step
          because it may not exist any future state satisfying those
          constraints.
