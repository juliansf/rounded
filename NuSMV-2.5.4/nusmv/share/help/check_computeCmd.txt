  check_compute - Performs computation of quantitative characteristics
     __________________________________________________________________

   check_compute [-h] [-m | -o output-file] [-n number | -p "compute-expr
   [IN context]" | -P "name"]

   This command deals with the computation of quantitative characteristics
   of real time systems. It is able to compute the length of the shortest
   (longest) path from two given set of states.

                            MAX [ alpha , beta ]

                            MIN [ alpha , beta ]

   Properties of the above form can be specified in the input file via the
   keyword COMPUTE or directly at command line, using option -p.

   Option -n can be used for computing a particular expression in the
   model. If neither -n nor -p nor -P are used, all the COMPUTE
   specifications are computed.

   Command options:

   -m
          Pipes the output generated by the command in processing COMPUTEs
          to the program specified by the PAGER shell variable if defined,
          else through the UNIX command "more".

   -o output-file
          Writes the output generated by the command in processing
          COMPUTEs to the file output-file.

   -p "compute-expr [IN context]"
          A COMPUTE formula to be checked. context is the module instance
          name which the variables in compute-expr must be evaluated in.

   -n number
          Computes only the property with index number

   -P name
          Computes only the property named name
