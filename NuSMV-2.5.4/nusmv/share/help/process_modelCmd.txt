  process_model - Performs the batch steps and then returns control to the
  interactive shell.

   process_model [-h] [-f] [-r] [-i model-file] [-m Method]

   Reads the model, compiles it into BDD and performs the model checking
   of all the specification contained in it. If the environment variable
   forward_search has been set before, then the set of reachable states is
   computed. If the option -r is specified, the reordering of variables is
   performed accordingly. This command simulates the batch behavior of
   NuSMV and then returns the control to the interactive shell.

   Command options:

   -f
          Forces model construction even when COI is enabled.

   -r
          Performs a variable ordering at the end of the computation, and
          dumps the variable ordering as the command line option -reorder
          does.

   -i model-file
          Sets the environment variable input_file to file model-file, and
          reads the model from file model-file.

   -m Method
          Sets the environment variable partition_method to Method and
          uses it as partitioning method.
