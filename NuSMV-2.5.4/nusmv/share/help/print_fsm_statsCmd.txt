  print_fsm_stats - Prints out information about the fsm and clustering.
     __________________________________________________________________

   print_fsm_stats [-h] | [-m] | [-p] | [-o output-file]

   This command prints out information regarding the fsm and each cluster.
   In particular for each cluster it prints out the cluster number, the
   size of the cluster (in BDD nodes), the variables occurring in it, the
   size of the cube that has to be quantified out relative to the cluster
   and the variables to be quantified out.

   Also the command can print all the normalized predicates the FMS
   consists of. A normalized predicate is a boolean expression which does
   not have other boolean sub-expressions. For example, expression (b<0 ?
   a/b : 0) = c is normalized into (b<0 ? a/b=c : 0=c) which has 3
   normalized predicates inside: b<0, a/b=c, 0=c. Command options:

   -m
          Pipes the output generated by the command through the program
          specified by the PAGER shell variable if defined, or through the
          UNIX utility "more".

   -p
          Prints out the normalized predicates the FSM consists of.

   -o output-file
          Redirects the generated output to the file output-file.
