   language_emptiness [-h] [-v] [-a]

   Checks for the language emptiness.
   If -a is given the check is performed by verifying whether all initial
   states are included in the set of fair states. If it is the case from
   all initial states there exists a fair path and thus the language is
   not empty. On the other hand, if no -a is specified, the check is
   performed by verifying whether there exists at least one inital state
   that is also a fair state. In this case there is an initial state from
   which it starts a fair path and thus the lnaguage is not empty. if -v
   is specified, then some information on the set of initial states is
   printed out too.
