  write_boolean_model - Writes a flattened and booleanized model of a given SMV
  file
     __________________________________________________________________

   write_boolean_model [-h] [-o filename]

   Writes the currently loaded SMV model in the specified file, after
   having flattened and booleanized it. Processes are eliminated and a
   corresponding equivalent model is printed out. If no file is specified,
   the file specified via the environment variable
   output_boolean_model_file is used if any, otherwise standard output is
   used.

   Command options:

   -o filename
          Attempts to write the flat and boolean SMV model in filename.

   ** New in 2.4.0 and later ** Scalar variables are dumped as DEFINEs
   whose body is their boolean encoding. This allows the user to still
   express and see parts of the generated boolean model in terms of the
   original model's scalar variables names and values, and still keeping
   the generated model purely boolean. Also, symbolic constants are dumped
   within a CONSTANTS statement to declare the values of the original
   scalar variables' for future reading of the generated file.
