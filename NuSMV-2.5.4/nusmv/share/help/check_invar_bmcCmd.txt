  check_invar_bmc - Generates and solve the given invariant, or all invariants
  if no formula is given
     __________________________________________________________________

   check_invar_bmc [-h | -n idx | -p "formula" [IN context] | -P "name"]
   [-k max_length] [-a algorithm] [-o filename]

   Command options:

   -n index
          index is the numeric index of a valid INVAR specification
          formula actually located in the properties database.
          The validity of index value is checked out by the system.

   -p "formula [IN context]"
          Checks the formula specified on the command-line.
          context is the module instance name which the variables in
          formula must be evaluated in.

   -P name
          Checks the INVARSPEC property with name name in the property
          database.

   -k max_length
          (Use only when selected algorithm is een-sorensson). Use to
          specify the maximal deepth to be reached by the een-sorensson
          invariant checking algorithm. If not specified, the value
          assigned to the system variable bmc_length is taken.

   -a algorithm
          Uses the specified algorithm to solve the invariant. If used,
          this option will override system variable bmc_invar_alg. At the
          moment, possible values are: "classic", "een-sorensson".

   -e
          Uses an additional step clause for algorithm "een-sorensson".
          filename is the name of the dumped dimacs file, without
          extension.
          It may contain special symbols which will be macro-expanded to
          form the real file name. Possible symbols are:
          - @F: model name with path part
          - @f: model name without path part
          - @n: index of the currently processed formula in the properties
          database
          - @@: the '@' character
