  clean_sexp2bdd_cache - Cleans the cache used during evaluation of expressions
  to ADD and BDD representations.

   clean_sexp2bdd_cache [-h]

   During conversion of symbolic (node_ptr) expressions to ADD and BDD
   representations the results of evaluations are normally cached (see
   additionally NuSMV option enable_sexp2bdd_caching). This allows to save
   time by avoid the construction of BDD for the same expression several
   time. In some situations it may be preferable to clean the cache and
   free collected ADD and BDD. This operation can be done, for example, to
   free some memory. Another possible reason is that dynamic reordering
   may modify all existing BDDs, and cleaning the cache thereby freeing
   the BDD may speed up the reordering. This command is designed
   specifically to free the internal cache of evaluated expressions and
   their ADDs and BDDs. Note that only the cache of exp-to-bdd evaluator
   is freed. BDDs of variables, constants and expressions collected in BDD
   FSM or anywhere else are not touched.
