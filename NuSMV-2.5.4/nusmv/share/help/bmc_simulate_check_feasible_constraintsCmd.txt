  bmc_simulate_check_feasible_constraints - Performs a feasibility check on the
  list of given constraints. Constraints that are found to be feasible can be
  safely assumed not to cause deadlocks if used in the following step of
  incremental simulation.

   bmc_simulate_check_feasible_constraints [-h | -q] [-c "formula"]*

   This command generates feasibility problems for each constraint. Every
   constraint is checked against current state and FSM's transition
   relation, in order to exclude the possibility of deadlocks. Constraints
   found to be feasible can be safely assumed not to cause deadlocks if
   used in the following step of incremental simulation.

   Command options:

   -q
          Enables quiet mode. For each analyzed constraint "0" is printed
          if the constraint is found to be unfeasible, "1" is printed
          otherwise.

   -c "formula"
          Provide a constraint as a formula specified on the command-line.
          This option can be specified multiple times, in order to analyze
          a list of constraints.
