     __________________________________________________________________

   execute_partial_traces [-h] [-v] [-r] [-m | -o output-file] -e engine
   [-a | trace_number]

   Executes traces stored in the Trace Manager. If no trace is specified,
   last registered trace is executed. Traces are not required to be
   complete. Upon succesful termination, a new complete trace is
   registered in the Trace Manager.

   Command Options:

   -v
          Verbosely prints traces execution steps.

   -a
          Executes all the currently stored traces.

   -r
          Performs restart on complete states (deprecated).

   -m
          Pipes the output through the program specified by the PAGER
          shell variable if defined, else through the UNIX command "more".

   -o output-file
          Writes the output generated by the command to output-file

   -e engine
          Selects an engine for trace re-execution. It must be one of
          'bdd', 'sat'.

   trace_number
          The (ordinal) identifier number of the trace to be printed.
