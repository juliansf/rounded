  show_property - Shows the currently stored properties
     __________________________________________________________________

   show_property [-h] [[-c | -l | -i | -q] [-u | -t | -f]] | [-n
   property_number] | [-P property_name] | [-s] [-m | -o output-file] [-F
   format]

   Shows the properties currently stored in the list of properties. This
   list is initialized with the properties (CTL, LTL, INVAR, COMPUTE)
   present in the input file, if any; then all of the properties added by
   the user with the relative check or add_property commands are appended
   to this list. For every property, the following informations are
   displayed:
     * the identifier of the property (a progressive number);
     * the property formula;
     * the type (CTL, LTL, INVAR, COMPUTE) the status of the formula
       (Unchecked, True, False) or the result of the quantitative
       expression, if any (it can be infinite);
     * if the formula has been found to be false, the number of the
       corresponding counterexample trace.

   By default, all the properties currently stored in the list of
   properties are shown. Specifying the suitable options, properties with
   a certain status (Unchecked, True, False) and/or of a certain type
   (e.g. CTL, LTL), or with a given identifier, it is possible to let the
   system show a restricted set of properties. It is allowed to insert
   only one option per status and one option per type.

   Command options:

   -c
          Prints only CTL properties.

   -l
          Prints only LTL properties.

   -i
          Prints only INVAR properties.

   -q
          Prints only quantitative (COMPUTE) properties.

   -u
          Prints only unchecked properties.

   -t
          Prints only those properties found to be true.

   -f
          Prints only those properties found to be false.

   -n property-number
          Prints out the property numbered property-number.

   -P property-name
          Prints out the property named property-name.

   -m
          Pipes the output through the program specified by the PAGER
          shell variable if defined, else through the UNIX "more" command.

   -o output-file
          Writes the output generated by the command to output-file.

   -F format
          print with given format. Use -F help to see available formats.

   -s Prints the number of stored properties.
