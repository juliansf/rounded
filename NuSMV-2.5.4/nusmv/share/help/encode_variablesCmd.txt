  encode_variables - Builds the BDD variables necessary to compile the model
  into BDD.
     __________________________________________________________________

   encode_variables [-h] [-i order-file]

   Generates the boolean BDD variables and the ADD needed to encode
   propositionally the (symbolic) variables declared in the model.
   The variables are created as default in the order in which they appear
   in a depth first traversal of the hierarchy.

   The input order file can be partial and can contain variables not
   declared in the model. Variables not declared in the model are simply
   discarded. Variables declared in the model which are not listed in the
   ordering input file will be created and appended at the end of the
   given ordering list, according to the default ordering.

   Command options:

   -i order-file
          Sets the environment variable input_order_file to order-file,
          and reads the variable ordering to be used from file order-file.
          This can be combined with the write_order command. The variable
          ordering is written to a file, which can be inspected and
          reordered by the user, and then read back in.
