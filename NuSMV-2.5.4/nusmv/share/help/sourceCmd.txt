  source - Executes a sequence of commands from a file
     __________________________________________________________________

   source [-h] [-p] [-s] [-x] <file> [<args>]

   Reads and executes commands from a file.

   Command options:

   -p
          Prints a prompt before reading each command.

   -s
          Silently ignores an attempt to execute commands from a
          nonexistent file.

   -x
          Echoes each command before it is executed.

   <file>
          File name

   Arguments on the command line after the filename are remembered but not
   evaluated. Commands in the script file can then refer to these
   arguments using the history substitution mechanism.

   EXAMPLE:

   Contents of test.scr:

   read_model -i %:2
   flatten_hierarchy
   build_variables
   build_model
   Typing "source test.scr short.smv" on the command line will execute the
   sequence

   read_model -i short.smv
   flatten_hierarchy
   build_variables
   build_model
   (In this case %:0 gets "source", %:1 gets "test.scr", and %:2 gets
   "short.smv".) If you type "alias st source test.scr" and then type "st
   short.smv bozo", you will execute

   read_model -i bozo
   flatten_hierarchy
   build_variables
   build_model
   because "bozo" was the second argument on the last command line typed.
   In other words, command substitution in a script file depends on how
   the script file was invoked. Switches passed to a command are also
   counted as positional parameters. Therefore, if you type "st -x
   short.smv bozo", you will execute
   read_model -i short.smv
   flatten_hierarchy
   build_variables
   build_model
   To pass the "-x" switch (or any other switch) to "source" when the
   script uses positional parameters, you may define an alias. For
   instance, "alias srcx source -x".

   returns -3 if an error occurs and the flag 'on_failure_script_quits' is
   set.
