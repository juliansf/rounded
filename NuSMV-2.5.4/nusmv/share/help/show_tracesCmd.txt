     __________________________________________________________________

   show_traces [ [-h] [-v] [-m | -o output-file] [-A] -t | [-d] -a |
   trace_number[.from_state[:[to_state]]] ]

   Shows the traces currently stored in system memory, if any. By default
   it shows the last generated trace, if any. A trace number can be
   specified optionally followed by a slice denoting the steps top be
   shown. Negative numbers can be used to denote steps in a right-to-left
   fashion. (i.e. -1 denotes last step, -2 is the previous and so forth.)

   Command Options:

   -v
          Verbosely prints traces content (all state variables, otherwise
          it prints out only those variables that have changed their value
          from previous state).

   -t
          Prints only the total number of currently stored traces.

   -a
          Prints all the currently stored traces.

   -A
          Prints traces in an anonimized form.

   -d
          Disables DEFINEs printout in traces

   -p trace plugin
          Uses the specified trace plugin to explain the trace.

   -m
          Pipes the output through the program specified by the PAGER
          shell variable if defined, else through the UNIX command "more".

   -o output-file
          Writes the output generated by the command to output-file

   trace_number
          The (ordinal) identifier number of the trace to be printed.

   from_state
          Denotes left end of the trace slice to be printed.

   to_state
          Denotes right end of the trace slice to be printed.
