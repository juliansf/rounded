  _bmc_test_tableau - Generates a random formula to logically test the
  equivalent tableau
     __________________________________________________________________

   _bmc_test_tableau [-h] | [-n property_index] | [[ -d max_depth] [-c
   max_conns] [-o operator]]

   Use this hidden command to generate random formulae and to test the
   equivalent tableau. The first time this command is called in the
   current NuSMV session it creates a new smv file with a model and
   generates a random ltl spec to test tableau. The following times it is
   called it appends a new formula to the file. The generated model
   contains the same number of non-deterministic variables the currently
   model loaded into NuSMV contains.
   You cannot call this command if the bmc_loopback is set to '*' (all
   loops).
